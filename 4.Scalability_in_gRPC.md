### Scalability in gRPC
- gRPC servers are asynchronous by default, this means they do not block threads on request
- therefore each gRPC server can serve millions of requests in parallel.

- gRPC Clients can be asynchronous or synchronous (blocking)
- The client decides which model works best for the performance needs.
- gRPC Clients can perform client side load balencing

Proof:
Google has 10 billion gRPC requests being made per second internally.
