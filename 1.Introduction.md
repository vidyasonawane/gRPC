What is gRPC?
- free and open source framework developed by google
- part of CNCF
- at high level, it allows you to define REQUEST and RESPONSE for RPC and handles all the rest for you.
- it is a modern, fast and efficient, build on top of HTTP/2, low latency, supports streaming, language independent, and makes it super easy to plug in authentication, load balencing, logging and monitoring.

What is an RPC?
- Remote Procedure call
- In your client code, it looks like you are just calling a function directly on the server.
- It's not a new concept
- with gRPC, it's implemented very cleanly and solves a lot of problems.

Why Protocol Buffers?
- Language agnostic
- easy to write message definition
- Code can be generated for pretty much any language.
- A huge amount of code can be generated, in any language, from a simple .proto file.
- Data is binary and efficiently serialized (small payloads)
- the payload is binary, therefore very efficient to send/ receive on a network and serialize/de-serialize on CPU
- Very convenient for transporting a lot of data
- allows for easy API evolution using rules.
- Protocol buffers defines rules to make an API evolve without breaking existing clients, which is helpful for microservices.

Efficiency of protocol buffers over JSON?
- Parsing JSON is actually CPU intensive (because the format is human readable)
- Parsing protocol buffers(binary format) is less CPU intensive because it is closer to how a machine represents data.
- 6 times faster communication than json.
- By using gRPC, the use of Protocol buffers means faster and more efficient communication, friendly with mobile devices that have a slower CPU.

Languages Supported:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Go
- Ruby
- C#
- Node.js
- Android Java
- Objective-C
- PHP
- Dart

gRPC can be used by any language
- because the code can be generated for any language, it makes it super simple to create micro-services in any language that interact with each other.
