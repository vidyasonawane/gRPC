| gRPC | REST |
|---|---|
|Protocol Buffers - smaller and faster | JSON - text based, slower and bigger |
| HTTP/2 - lower latency | HTTP1.1 - higher latency |
| Biderectional and Async | Client => Server requests only |
| Stream Support | Request/Response support only |
| API Oriented - "What" (no constraints - free design) | CRUD Oriented (Create, retrive, update,Delete/ POST GET PUT DELETE) |
| Code Generation through Protocol buffers in any language - 1st class citizen | Code generation through OpenAPI/ Swagger (add-on) - 2nd class citizen |
| RPC Based - gRPC does the plumbing for us | HTTP verbs based - we have to write the plumbing or use a 3rd parth library |
