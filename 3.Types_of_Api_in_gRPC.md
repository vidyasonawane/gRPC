4 Types of API in gRPC:

1. Unary
2. Server streaming
3. Client streaming
4. Bi directional streaming

#### Unary API
- a request response API, you send something and you receive something.

#### Server Streaming
- with one request of client, server will send all the data in streams,client don't need to request the data again.

#### Client streaming
- clinet will open the streaming connection and sent to the server one msg, 2nd msg, 3rd msg and so on
- and expect the response from server.

#### Bi Directional streaming
- Client and server both will share the streaming data.


=================================================================

- Unary is what a traditional API looks like (HTTP API)
- HTTP/2, enables APIs to now have streaming capabilities.
- The server and client can push multiple messages as part of one request.
- In gRPC it is very easy to define these APIs.
