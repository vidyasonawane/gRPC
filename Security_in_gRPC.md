- By default, gRPC strongly advocates for you to use SSL (encryption over the wire) in your API
- This means that gRPC has security as a first class citizen
- Each language will provide an API to load gRPC with the required certificates and provide encryption capability out of the box.
- Additionally using Interceptors, we can also provide authentication
