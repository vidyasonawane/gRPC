- gRPC leverages HTTP/2 as backbone for communication
- demo: imagekit.io
- HTTP/2 is the newer standard for internet communications that address common pitfall of HTTP/1.1 on modern web pages.

Before we go into HTTP/2, let's look at how HTTP/1.1 works:
- HTTP 1.1 was released in 1997. It has worked great for many years.
- HTTP 1.1 opens a new TCP connection to server at each request
- It does not compress headers (which are plaintext)
- It only works with Request/Response mechanism (no server push)
- HTTP was originally composed of two commands
  - GET: to ask for content
  - POST: to send content
- Nowadays, a web page loads 80 assets on average
- Headers are sent at every request and are PLAINTEXT (heavy size)
- Each request opens a TCP Connection
- These inefficiencies add latency and increase network packet size.

How HTTP/2 works:
- HTTP 2 was released in 2015. It has been battled tested for many years!
- HTTP2 supports multiplexing
  - the client and server can push messages in parallel over the same TCP connection.
  - This greatly reduce latency.
- HTTP 2 supports server push
  - Servers can push streams (multiple messages) for one request from the client.
  - This saves round trips (Latency)
- HTTP 2 supports header compression
  - Headers (text based) can now be compressed
  - These have much less impact on the packet size
  - (remember the average http request may have over 20 headers, due to cookies, content catche, and application headers)  
- HTTP/2 is binary
  - While HTTP/1 text makes it easy for debugging, it is not efficient over the network.
  - Protocol buffers is a binary protocol and makes it a great match for HTTP2
- HTTP/2 is secure (SSL is not required but recommended by default)


Summary:
- Less chatter
- More efficient protocol (less bandwidth)
- Reduced latency
- Increased security
